Fiber Deployment Workflow Management System

A web-based system built using Django and PostgreSQL for managing fiber development workflows, document uploads, and task assignments. This platform streamlines fiber deployment tasks, assigns work to responsible groups based on area conditions (metro/region), and ensures all documentation is digitally maintained and managed.



üîç Project Overview
This system is designed to replace a manual, hardcopy-based process with a centralized digital platform.

Key Features:

Secure login for Admin, Employee, and Contractor users with role-based dashboards.

Contractors can upload and manage required documents.

Real-time updates and tracking of fiber deployment tasks.

Structured task flows handled by different workgroups with conditional logic.
